<unit name="test_subdir/ok_relative_include_1.pas">
  <description><detailed>This is a test unit that includes ok_relative_include_conf.inc file two times. Note that the ok_relative_include_conf.inc file is in the same directory as this unit, so no matter what is current dir when running pasdoc --- you should not need to add any -I option to pasdoc to find ok_relative_include_conf.inc.</detailed></description>
