  <description><detailed>This is another test unit that includes ok_relative_include_conf.inc file two times. This time note that the ok_relative_include_conf.inc file is already in the parent directory of this unit file, so once again no matter what is current dir when running pasdoc --- you should not need to add any -I option to pasdoc to find ok_relative_include_conf.inc.</detailed></description>
