    <description><detailed>These are links from class' description to an identifiers inside the same class. Note that @links here first check *inside* the class, then outside (i.e. in the whole unit). That's why link to Foo below is a link to a method Foo inside this class, not to a global procedure Foo. Links inside the class: Foo, Sthg. Links outside of the class: ok_link_class_unit_level.Foo, Xyz. Note that I has to qualify Foo with unit's name and write &quot;ok_link_class_unit_level.Foo&quot; to get a link to procedure in the unit. Just like I would do in a Pascal code.</detailed></description>
