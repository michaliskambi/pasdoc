\chapter{Unit ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}1}
\section{Description}
This is a test unit that includes ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}conf.inc file two times.

Note that the ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}conf.inc file is in the same directory as this unit, so \textbf{no matter what is current dir when running pasdoc} --- you should not need to add any {-}I option to pasdoc to find ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}conf.inc.
\chapter{Unit ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}2}
\section{Description}
This is another test unit that includes ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}conf.inc file two times.

This time note that the ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}conf.inc file is already in the parent directory of this unit file, so once again \textbf{no matter what is current dir when running pasdoc} --- you should not need to add any {-}I option to pasdoc to find ok{\_}relative{\_}include{\_}conf.inc.
